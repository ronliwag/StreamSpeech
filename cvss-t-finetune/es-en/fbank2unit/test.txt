the other one laughed happily:
The sister opened.
After a tiring and long day started.
Julio César stops at the door, under the flag that the curtains form.
One, two, three, four, five.
This an oil dealer from Vigo.
Where is the rebel base? Speak!
It’s time to take off.
Two hours away, Sir.
It’s better to leave it as it is.
they do a very well tripe
Of our ship.
Fray Lope Castellar officiated, and in freeing of my sins, I served as an acolyte.
the one that puts herself with the window open..
With only three months was enough!
It’s very important to try to prevent the outbreak from spreading.
I was getting married at the time of the shipwreck.
I'm in my stateroom, not in a night club.
When we got there, the nun left the fence:
One bullet, sir.
I felt on my gut the cold of the steel.
I searched upside down, honey, all that I could do to fix your hat
When we got close, they greeted us in a Christian manner:
Survival in five minutes. Come.
To another site? because if I leave you alone.
I’ll wash my hands, okay? Ulises!
And he smiles showing his white teeth of familiar animal.
Without thinking further, I resolved to navigate the seas.
Just with one hand I can kick your ass.
Each one his house, and God in everyone's houses.
Stop caring about their families, right?
It can't be my friend:
Enough of your chit-chat! Go to sleep.
I don't think so.
we have been playing and they gave me apples
Is that they die like rats.
The three steps for a perfect date.
The nun opened a door of old tracery, and stepping aside she muttered:
Listen to this, I recorded it this afternoon on deck.
have you seen him?
Waves are longitudinal.
it kills me, my father kills me, calm, I take the risks
Good, back! Back off, cannibals!
In September we’ll go harvesting throughout José de Carro.
Four coins, don’t be stupid!
our horses, exhausted for such a difficult journey
A silent and quiet river with whitish water like milk.
we have just one week before we move
Like capes, light bulbs.
Palomares, breathe! Come on pal!
There is no time to lose.
Have you done something to him?
but at least we will be trying to save lives
we can talk about it if you want, ok?
Everything else was already taken.
Is there something with the shape of a dinosaur?
it’s not like eating pop corn but it’s very similar
Paloma San Basilio.
Let’s rehearse all the moves, we have no time.
The waiters are tall and strong.
Do you think that they are going to come back?
The black box.
They complained about every move and the looser would threaten the winner.
Not like this one.
The squares on the holes for the squares,
The Chole girl hindered holding to the tragic and devastated rein.
Fix the lever.
Damn, I better shave.
No, he doesn’t suspect nothing at all, although I had to use
You are sad, strange little man, and you have my mercy. Goodbye.
Then we kissed and...
Not in the cellar, because he’s scared of it.
I want to decide by myself!
Leave that space thing alone! It’s getting me nervous.
the laser is on
They say they will go, they won't go to your wedding.
There’s something fishy going on.
To their children, desperately...
Because the whole crew saw you.
But we are not in my planet.
Careful with the little paw.
His bloody feats are the feats that in other times made the epics flourish.
To the guide cable. Ignition material ready.
I've been listening laments and complaints for weeks,
I attend to the slow going and coming of those Native Indians wearing sheets like phantoms.
I’m the one who should be tied to this rocket.
Everybody is the author of their happiness.
It’s the first time I see the kids doing something together.
I had to kick it with the spur and get it to run.
To get free from that torture, I called the Native Indian I was taking as a guide.
Look, they came back.
A horde of riders was in front of the door.
Will you finish?
We went out to the patio, where the Indian waited with the horses of the dexterous man:
The professors are overqualified.
I like trains.
The fleet is dispersing.
Okay, step, step.
We either follow the duck or stay alive.
We should say goodbye!
The countdown will begin momentarily.
I hate you, and there's nothing in this world that can change that.
That is said throughout the ship.
You have done me the greatest favor of my life.
Half way was laying a rider.
Maybe you need some help.
Maybe you prefer to be alone. Alone?
I've arrived.
Follow the three steps for a perfect date.
I want to visit an added person with the local mayor.
And to disguise the tremor on my lips, they should be bruised, but I was smiling.
I cannot look at you to the face. You take it too seriously.
He’s really excited
No, no, no, it doesn’t work, no.
I'm not ok.
Do you think I went shopping?
Let them saddle.
I repeat: do not go up on deck.
What a battle have you given tonight?
I think that I am just annoying.
How did you know it was me?
With the hands full of saltpeter.
But he is wrong.
The distress for the dizziness could be seen in the eyelids.
A lot of information is saved from the airplanes.
Palomares, wait, Palomares
